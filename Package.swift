        // declares swift-tools 6.3.0 — unreadable by the Xcode the CI runners
        // are on, so the whole graph fails to RESOLVE there. 68947cc is the last
        // of the three Gemma fixes and sits before that commit, so it buys the
        // fixes without the toolchain jump. Move forward once CI's Xcode is
        // upgraded (that is Phil's call), not before.
